Code Review:
At the beginning of the assignment, we have decided to use GitHub as our code repository. During the process of coding, we use different branches to achieve our separate tasks and check and review each other¡¯s code when ¡°pull-request¡±. Requirements analysis and tracing:
Since the group is so small that detailed brain storming is in high efficient, we decide to discuss the Assignment Spec piece by piece. During the requirement discussing, most time is spent on behavior, interaction and ICD ads. Since the specification is clear, the requirement analysis does not take much time. After implementation, we check the requirement according to the spec by testing the programme.
Programming:
The most difficult part for us is coding using a new language, it takes some time to achieve what we want to implement. The strategy we use is to discuss interaction API(ICD.ads) first and implement ICD and Closedloop separately. And exchange code to understand how partner codes. This helps us understand the code (both given and written by us) easily since different people is focusing on different parts.
Testing:
During the process of solution, we¡¯ve done some unit test with and functional test. There are some functions implemented for test purpose during the process of coding and after testing, some of the function will be removed from the code to secure the system (because some functions and values should not be exposed to others). After general implantation, we have done some integration tests running times and/or modifying parameters.
